## Description
Foodies: Discover the best restaurants in your area.

With a database of more than 20000 restaurants spread across the United States, Foodies shapes the future of your food search.

1.	Restaurant Search: Be it fast food, or be it american, any user can get access to all the restaurants in the city, serving food across 70 different categories. 
2.	Food Chain and Category based Filters: Filters can be applied on the restaurants to find restaurants from any particular food-chain (For example, Find the McDonald’s and Subways in your city). Filters can also be applied to find the restaurants serving any particular category of food. (For example, Find the restaurants serving Italian, Chinese, American Food, etc.)
3.	List your restaurant: Any new restaurant opened anywhere in the US can get itself listed on Foodies, to drive customers to its outlets.
4.	Data Insights: We have something in store for fact-lovers too. Get to know a variety of Foodie-Facts about your city. Visit the Data Insights page, and get to know:
     - The total number of restaurants in your city compared to the national average.
     - A Histogram Plot of the number of McDonalds, Subways, Burger Kings, Dominos, Pizza Huts, KFC’s in your city compared to the National Average.
     - Where your city ranks in terms of the number of restaurants.
     - The latest added restaurant in your city

We got the motivation for the project from Zomato, which does similar work for India. In order to include some Database concepts, we have added the Data-Insights Section and the Filter Feature. Further, the “List Your Restaurant” page allows a person to add the restaurant to our database.
Here is the ER Diagram of our database:
